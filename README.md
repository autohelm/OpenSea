# OpenSea

This project is an effort to create an open source firmware to run on the Pelagic autopilot system (https://pelagicautopilot.com/).  Upon opening my Pelagic, I was pleasantly surprised that the unit uses a non-soldered Teensy++ 2.0 as the brains of the unit.  As a result, it is possible to easily plug in a new Teensy in order to run custom code on the nicely crafted Pelagic hardware.  By popping the original teensy back in, the factory functionality can be quickly restored.  

This should allow either porting PyPilot or interfacing to a PyPilot system as well as additional sensors, comms interfaces, etc.
